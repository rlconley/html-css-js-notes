# Different Modalities We Use In Class
## This course is job training, and it's similar to learning an instrument, sport, or a trade. The modalities we use are designed to give you as much guided practice as possible.

# Live Coding
- Your instructor *and* your classmates will be live coding quite a bit during the course.
- You aren't meant to type along character by character. Coding isn't linear. There aren't steps 1, 2, 3, 4. 
- Listen actively, try to understand what's happening, and then look at the resulting code afterwards. *The instructor will push code from class to the class GitHub organization.* 
- Figure out a note-taking strategy that works for you for capturing main concepts, new vocabulary, and questions, either online with a tool like Notion or Google Docs or on paper. A framework like [Cornell Notes](https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b) may be helpful.

# Lecture
- Lectures with slides are used to provide context for coding. The content of the slides can be found in the *notes* repository in the Team 13 GitHub organization.

# Group Work
- We will do a lot of coding and code review in small groups. Group work is most effective when everyone contributes. Contributing includes both asking and answering questions.
- Most of the work you do as a professional developer will be in groups. The tools and structures we use, such as Slack, GitHub, and Zoom are the same tools you will use in your job, so participating actively will help prepare you.
